A handler is a collection of pipes and pipe wiring statements.

Handlers may be stateful, or a special type of them can be stateful (perhaps there's some trick here with wiring statements a la closures) to enable systems that manage resources.

Stateful handlers are very strong analogues of classes in OOP languages with the chief distinctions that:
    -they cannot be serialized into a value
    -the can only send/receive values, and thus the "messages" they pass to eachother are immutable values
    -therefore, they cannot be passed as references to other handlers

Removing pass by reference removes many of the dangers and pitfalls of OOP.

Not treating handlers as first class values is very limiting--we're removing many of the "gang of four" patterns, and we're well on our way to removing functional composition as well.
